Single 1 inch diameter He3 Neutron Detector. Geometry is based off of the thesis by Dr. Scott Walker:
Spectrally Matched Neutron Detectors Designed Using Computational Adjoing SN for Plug-In Replacement of Helium-3.

Geometry:
----------------------------------------------
A single 1 inch diameter, 10 cm tall He3 neutron detector with a 1 mm aluminum shell. The detector is surrounded by G4_Polyethylene as a neutron moderator.


Physics:
-----------------------------------------------
Recommended physics list utilizes the NeutronHP package to transport low energy neutrons (below 20 MeV). This package allows for the proper handling of elastic scattering off certain materials down to thermal energies.
